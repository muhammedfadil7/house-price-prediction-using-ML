# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction and Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices based on various property features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other attributes.  
It combines **data analysis** and **machine learning** techniques to provide insights into the housing market and build accurate predictive models.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Contains property-related attributes, including:
  - Location
  - Area (square feet/meters)
  - Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
  - Year built
  - Condition and grade
  - Price
- Target variable: **House Price**

---

## ⚙️ Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new derived features
   - Removing irrelevant columns
   - Addressing multicollinearity

4. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** (Data Handling)
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Models)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
